# Supervised Learning - Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

### 0-inception_block.py - Contains te function def inception_block(A_prev, filters) which builds an inception block as described in the paper "Going deeper with convolutions" (Szegedy et al. 2014).

### 1-inception_network - Contains the function def inception_network() which builds out the inception network.

### 2-identity_block.py - Contains the function def identity_block(A_prev, filters) which builds an identity block as described in "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" (He et al. 2015).
