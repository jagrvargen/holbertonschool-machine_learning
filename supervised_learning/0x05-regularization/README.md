# Supervised Learning - Regularization

### 0-l2_reg_cost.py - Contains the function definition l2_reg_cost(cost, lambtha, weights, L, m) which calculates the cost of a neural network with L2 regularization. ** Note ** The parameter lambtha is spelled as such to avoid using or overwriting the Python operator lambda.

### 1-l2_reg_gradient_descent.py - Contains the function definition l2_reg_gradient_descent(Y, weights, cache, alpha, lambtha, L) which updates the weights of a neural network with L2 regularization using gradient descent.
