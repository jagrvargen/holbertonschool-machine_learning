# Supervised Learning - Keras

### 0-sequential.py - Contains the function definition build_model(nx, layers, activations, lambtha, keep_prob) which builds a neural network with the Keras library.

### 1-input.py - Contains the function definition build_model(nx, layers, activations, lambtha, keep_prob) which builds a neural network with the Keras library.

### 2-compile.py - Contains the function definition optimize_model(network, alpha, beta1, beta2) which compiles the model with Adam optimization.

### 3-one_hot.py - Contains the function definition one_hot(labels, classes=None) which converts a label vector into a one hot matrix.

### 4-train.py - Contains the function definition train_model(network, data, labels, batch_size, epochs, verbose=True) which trains a model using gradient descent.
