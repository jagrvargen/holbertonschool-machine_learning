# Supervised Learning - Binary Classification

### 0-neuron.py - Create a class Neuron which contains the public instance attributes W for the weights vector, b for the bias neuron, and A for the activated output of the neuron.

### 1-neuron.py - Same as the above class definition except that the public instance attributes are converted to private instance attributes with corresponding getter functions.
