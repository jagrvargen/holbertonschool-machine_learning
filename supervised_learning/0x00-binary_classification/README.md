# Supervised Learning - Binary Classification

### 0-neuron.py - Create a class Neuron which contains the public instance attributes W for the weights vector, b for the bias neuron, and A for the activated output of the neuron.

### 1-neuron.py - Same as the above class definition except that the public instance attributes are converted to private instance attributes with corresponding getter functions.

### 2-neuron.py - Adds a forward propagation method to the above class definition.

### 3-neuron.py - Adds the cost method which calculates the cost of the model using logistic regression.

### 4-neuron.py - Adds the evaluate method which evaluates the neuron's predictions.

### 5-neuron.py - Adds the a method to calculate one pass of gradient descent on the neuron.
