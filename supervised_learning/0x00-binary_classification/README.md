# Supervised Learning - Binary Classification

### 0-neuron.py - Create a class Neuron which contains the public instance attributes W for the weights vector, b for the bias neuron, and A for the activated output of the neuron.

### 1-neuron.py - Same as the above class definition except that the public instance attributes are converted to private instance attributes with corresponding getter functions.

### 2-neuron.py - Adds a forward propagation method to the above class definition.

### 3-neuron.py - Adds the cost method which calculates the cost of the model using logistic regression.

### 4-neuron.py - Adds the evaluate method which evaluates the neuron's predictions.

### 5-neuron.py - Adds the a method to calculate one pass of gradient descent on the neuron.

### 6-neuron.py - Adds the train method used to train the neuron.

### 7-neuron.py - Updates the training method to include options for verbose printing, graph rendering, and step tracking.

### 8-neural_network.py - Creates a new class NeuralNetwork akin to the Neuron class except with a single hidden layer.

### 9-neural_network.py - Convert public instance attributes to private instance attributes and add corresponding getter methods.

### 10-neural_network.py - Adds a method for forward propagation.

### 11-neural_network.py - Adds a method to calculate the cost of the model using logistic regression.
